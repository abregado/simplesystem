# Simplesystem System for Foundry v11
This system is designed to be as streamlined as possible. It is based on the Boilerplate system.

## Features

### Players can store common rolls
Action Items are simple objects which post their description to the chat when used.

Roll Items roll dice according to their formula string and post the result to the chat.

Check Items have a modifier string instead which is added to a d20 roll when used. The user can roll with advantage,
disadvantage or neither.

### Character sheets store these common role types
Character sheets have a minimum of statistics which are used in d20 game systems. All extra information is stored
in the form of Items (actions, rolls and checks). Each character sheet stores a list of associated Items.
